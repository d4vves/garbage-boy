# Garbage Boy

## What's going on here? 

Garbage Boy is tired. All they want to do is get back to their cozy garbage home and catch some z's. BUT ALAS! There are a bunch of nasty rats running around, and Garbage Boy HATES rats. If they come in contact with a rat, they will LITERALLY die. 

Garbage Boy also hates littering. Make sure to pick up garbage on your way home, otherwise Garbage Boy will be sad. If Garbage Boy becomes too weighed down by the reality of their part in the destruction of our planet, they will not be able to continue on. //Pro-tip: picking up garbage will not only keep Garbage Boy happy but will invigorate them and reward a stat boost!

TLDR: Move Garbage Boy back home to their trash can without touching any of those nasty rats. Pick up garbage to keep Garbage Boy happy //and gain some sick stat boosts.

## MVP
- Render a CLI-like game screen displaying the canvas, GB's health, current stage, and GB's inventory
- Render a Garbage Boy character that can move freely using WASD keys
- Render GB's garbage can home which upon arrival will end the current stage and move on to the next stage
- Render three nasty rats at different X axis values that move up and down along the Y axis. If there is a collision, GB dies!
- Render a piece of garbage that when GB collides, it will be removed from the canvas
- If GB reaches their garbage can home without picking up the garbage, their movement speed will be decreased for the next level
- Every time you get GB to their home and start a new level, the rats movement speed is increased

## Stretch Goals
- Have rats spawn randomly on the canvas
- Have rats move randomly on the canvas
- Picking up garbage will add it to GB's inventory
- Ability to click on garbage in inventory to either make the rats movement pause for a few seconds or increase GB's movement speed
